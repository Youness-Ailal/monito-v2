          We first opened our doors in <span>2010</span> with the goal of being
          the most reliable and trusted pet supply store in the neighborhood.
          Monito Pets was founded by <span>Jane Smith</span>, a lifelong animal
          lover and pet owner. After working for over a decade at large chain
          pet stores, Jane dreamed of opening a smaller, friendlier shop where
          pets were treated like part of the family.
